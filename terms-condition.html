                                            suspend or discontinue any part of the Services or we may introduce new
                                            features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or
                                            all of the Service. We will try to give you notice when we make a material
                                            change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this is not
                                            always practical and non-binding. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove

                                            the Company, you will be subject to the rules, guidelines, policies, terms

                                            incorporated into this terms of use and shall be considered as part and
                                            parcel of this terms of use. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion,
